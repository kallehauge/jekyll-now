### Intro

Just a run through backing up my OS before making a complete install of an updated version. By the way, this is very much an inspired idea from the Facebook movie where he just dabbled as he goes. I have done this before on "real blogs", but this will be much more like a "for me" format.

### Backing up data

- Sites
- bash
- other configuration
- Desktop (basically just a random mix of downloads and documents)
- Personal files (pictures / downloads / videos)

### Bash

- History
- `.bashrc`
- `.profile` (included in .bashrc)
- scripts and functions

### Other configuration

- `~/.PhpStorm2018.3`
- `~/.ssh`
- `~/.gitconfig`
- `~/ssh-pems`
- `~/ngrok`

### Scripts and functions
