title: Formatting ubuntu
---

Just a run through backing up my OS before making a complete install of an updated version. By the way, this is very much an inspired idea from the Facebook movie where he just dabbled as he goes. I have done this before on "real blogs", but this will be much more like a "for me" format.

This is in no way a complete writing of what I do when I install Ubuntu ("click here and here" or in completion how I setup my system). It is more a sort of "remember the most important things" thingy.

### Backing up data

- Sites
- bash
- other configuration
- Desktop (basically just a random mix of downloads and documents)
- Personal files (pictures / downloads / videos)

### Bash

- History
- `.bashrc`
- `.profile` (included in .bashrc)
- scripts and functions

Some of the history configuration is inspired by https://www.shellhacks.com/tune-command-line-history-bash/.

### Other configuration

- `~/.PhpStorm2018.3`
- `~/.ssh`
- `~/.gitconfig`
- `~/ssh-pems`
- `~/ngrok`

### Scripts and functions

### List of software

- Spotify
- PhpStorm
- Poedit
- Atom
- Slack
- Postman
- Wunderlistux
- Videostream

### Snaps

- phpstorm
- atom
- spotify
- vlc
- ~~slack~~ wavebox
- poedit
- ~~noson (forget this?)~~

## Thoughts

To use, or not to use Budgie distro of Ubuntu? I think... not? Hmm! Not! Why not jump directly to 18.10 of default Ubuntu.
Before doing this I basically though that I would start to just stick with LTS but with changes like: 

> #### 5. Startup time boost and XDG Portals support for Snap applications
> Continuing its focus on Snap packages, Canonical is bringing some useful improvements to it. Snap applications will take less time to start. With XDG portal, you should be able to install Snap in a few clicks from the Snapcraft Store website.

and others (source: https://itsfoss.com/ubuntu-18-10-release-features/) ... it just seems like the right thing to do. I am currently on 17.10 and it was my first time switching to Linux (from OSX) and I've been battling with Wayland numerious of times... but 18.10 seems less "bad". No major changes like Wayland have happened and there are some battery + performance enhancements that just seems too good to pass since.
